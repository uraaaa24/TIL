# 📒 TIL — Today I Learned

✍️ **I jot down what I learn every day — one topic per Markdown file.**

- I drop in **one Markdown file per topic for each day's learning**.
- Folders are split by topic area, and file names follow the pattern `{topic}.md`.

_The only goal is to jot things down fast so future-me can find them later._
